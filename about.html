        			Chess is THE freshest board game, played in the chillest room, by the hottest dudes. We welcome everyone no matter how good you are. You could be as bad as Yaro or as mediocre as me, it doesn't matter. We meet every X-Block in Baker 100. We always have snacks like Oreos and Munchkins, that other leaders bring because I'm a freeloading slacker and can't be bothered with properly leading a club. Y'all are pathetic lol if you play Weiqi. We might host a bughouse tournament if people want it but probably not since Paulie isn't here to do it for me. Chess club has a team that plays against other schools in a league called the ISCLC I think. It's basically just the ISL for chess and we have won 6 or 7 years in a row now. We play in the Winter, every other Monday or so, against schools like RL and St. Sebs. You actually have to somewhat know how to play if you want to be on the team since it is slightly competitive. Come out to club! or don't if you don't want to... If you guys have any input I can change things but I probably will never look at this code again.
